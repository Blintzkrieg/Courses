<h4>Statistical Methods in Speech and Language Processing</h4>
    This course introduces the key concepts underlying statistical natural language processing. Students will learn a variety of techniques for the computational modeling of natural language, including: n-gram models, smoothing, Hidden Markov models, Bayesian Inference, Expectation Maximization, Viterbi, Inside-Outside Algorithm for Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars, and higher-order language models. Software: GitHub, Git Bash, Python: NLTK, SpaCy, numpy, scikit-learn. 

<h4>Advanced Computational linguistics</h4>
    This course provides a hands-on project-based approach to particular problems and issues in computational linguistics.  Students are expected to be able to gain enough familiarity to install, run and perform project work on these packages on their own machines. Projects to be tackled in this course are themed around the topic of language understanding:
        Treebanks (phrase-structure/dependency-based): e.g. Penn Treebank, lookup software.
        Part-of-speech taggers.
        The use and modification of statistical parsers trained on Treebanks
        Advanced linguistic theories
        Ontologies and Semantic Networks: WordNet etc.
        Question-Answering (QA)

<h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>
    Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of how we can teach computers to use language by extracting knowledge from text, and then use that knowledge in some meaningful way. In this introductory course, we will examine the fundamental components on which natural language processing systems are built, including frequency distributions, part of speech tagging, syntactic parsing, semantics and analyzing meaning, search, introductory information and relation extraction, and structured knowledge resources. We also examine pragmatic concerns in processing raw text from real-world sources.

<h4>Computational linguistics</h4>
    This is a introductory course in computational linguistics at an advanced level.
    Students implement finite state automata, transducers, parsers and translation programs based on grammar rules in a series of computer laboratory exercises. Software: Software: Perl, Python, Bash, SWI-Prolog, Ubuntu(Linux), Virtual Machine. In the case of numerical calculations, we make use of Microsoft Excel for worked examples and homework questions. 

<h4>Speech Technology</h4>
    Topics include speech synthesis, automatic speech recognition, acoustics, waveforms, spectrograms, and other speech technologies. This course gives students background for a career in the speech technology industry. Software: python, jupyter notebooks, Praat.

<h4>Formal Foundations</h4>
    Modern linguistic theory requires a working familiarity with several “formal”disciplines, e.g. set theory, logic, lambda calculus, formal language theory, probability theory, etc. The point of this course is to provide that familiarity, with particular attention to how those disciplines can be and are used in our field.

<h4>Language + Computers</h4>
    Fundamentals of processing of natural language and computational linguistics. Student learn to program using Python (3.x) and also learn to use computational tools such as NLTK for language analysis.
